                <p>React itself does not come with built-in support for routing. React is primarily a library for building user interfaces, and it doesn't include a full-fledged routing solution out of the box.
                    <br/>
                However, there are popular third-party libraries that can be used to handle routing in React applications. One such library is react-router, which provides a comprehensive routing solution for React applications.[25] It allows you to define routes, manage navigation, and handle URL changes in a React-friendly way.</p>
